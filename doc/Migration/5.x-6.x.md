# 5.x to 6.x

`Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcher` gets dropped and replaced by `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\PipeMiddleware`.
`Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcher` as an implements of `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` which is gone as well.

This makes the framework as bit less flexible for special use cases, but easier in use for the majority.

Resulting changes:
- `Chubbyphp\Framework\Handler\RouteRequestHandler::__construct` does not take a `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` as argument anymore.
- `Chubbyphp\Framework\Application::__construct` does not take a `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` as argument anymore.
