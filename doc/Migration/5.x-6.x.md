# 5.x to 6.x

`Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcher` gets dropped and replaced by `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\PipeMiddleware`.
`Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcher` as an implements of `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` which is gone as well.

This makes the framework as bit less flexible for special use cases, but easier in use for the majority.

Resulting changes:
- `Chubbyphp\Framework\Handler\RouteRequestHandler::__construct` does not take a `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` as argument anymore.
- `Chubbyphp\Framework\Application::__construct` does not take a `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\MiddlewareDispatcherInterface` and `Chubbyphp\Framework\Handler\RouteRequestHandler` as argument anymore.

**If you need a custom `Chubbyphp\Framework\Middleware\PipeMiddleware` for your use case:**

I suggest you:
- Create an own `Chubbyphp\Framework\Application` and `Chubbyphp\Framework\Handler\RouteRequestHandler` onces you read the code you'll see it's little to replace and to maintain yourself.
- Create an issue convincing me to find a better solution with you in collaboration

`Chubbyphp\Framework\Collection` gets dropped, cause i do not believe the additional runtime security for typing arrays was worth the performance hit. Use phpstan or something compatible to prevent mistakes in usage.
